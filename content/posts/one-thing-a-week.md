As you may have noticed, i am not the most frequent author - despite having lots of projects going on, which i could write about.

I want to change that. Lucky me i stumbled upon the "[One thing a week](https://www.timoschindler.de/ein-jahr-one-thing-a-week/)" challenge, which aims toward doing, documenting and telling one thing a week to you, my dearest readers.

I think, i'll accept this challenge. Last week, i already told you about a template for Obsidian, which i would count as week zero. I already have some completed projects which i just need to document and write down, so, stay tuned :)
